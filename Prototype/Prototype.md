# UX - Prototype (Optional - Designers / frontend developers only)

Suppose you are working on an app that uses maps for managing and designing new electric networks
(poles, wire segments, transformers, substations...). The user of your app needs to create a project in order
to design new elements in the electric network.
Design and prototype a screen for creating new projects. Each project needs to have the following
informations, provided by the user:
Project name (text)
Project deadline (date)
Project location. The user has to point a location on the map
Note: You can use any tools you want for drawing and prototyping, even pencil and paper. The result of this
test does not need to be an interactive prototype. You can share just screenshots or pictures of your
design.

## Prototype created using the Figma tool
